================================================================================================
A few important notes about the code below:-

The trigger name of routeAnimations must match the trigger used in the app component HTML.

Using wildcard syntax like * <=> * applies the default animation to all routes.

When an animation is triggered we have access the the previous page via the :leave selector, and the current page via the :enter selector. We can query these elements to style and animate them.
